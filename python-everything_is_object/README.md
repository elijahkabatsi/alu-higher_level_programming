# Python - Everything is Object

This project explores the core concept in Python that **everything is an object**. You'll answer conceptual and practical questions that reinforce how data types, identity, mutability, and references work in Python.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to:

- Understand and explain the difference between:
  - `id()`, `type()`, and `is`
  - Mutable vs immutable objects
  - Value vs reference in variable assignment
- Know how Python handles objects internally
- Identify when two variables reference the same object or different objects
- Understand how Python handles memory for different object types

## Project Structure

Each question in this project requires you to write a one-word or one-line answer in a `.txt` file. No Python scriptsâ€”just direct answers.

Example:
- `0-answer.txt`: Contains the name of the function used to determine the type of an object.

## Requirements

- All `.txt` files must contain exactly one line
- No blank lines or unnecessary spaces
- Answers must be precise (no explanations unless asked)
